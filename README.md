# node-mongo-redis-docker
Experimenting with NodeJS, MongoDB and Redis in Docker containers.

This example currently only works on one machine but I plan to update it with docker networking so a deploy can span multiple docker machines.


## What this example has
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Node app
- Run in Docker for development

## Why?
Docker is an excellent solution for development as it packages the entire environment into a single reproducible container. This has the advantage over traditional development as packages/dependencies are always the same across development/production environments.
